# Password_Strength
This python code uses machine learning and deep learning to predict and classify passwords into three categories :
1. weak
2. acceptable
3. strong


Due to data imbalance, downsampling approach has been used.

The dataset has been uploaded to the same branch of git as the code for ease of use, however it doesn't belong to me. All rights are reserved by the original author.
